A typedef-name can also be introduced by an alias-declaration. The identifier
following the using keyword becomes a typedef-name and the optional
attribute-specifier-seq following the identifier appertains to that
typedef-name. It has the same semantics as if it were introduced by the typedef
specifier. In particular, it does not define a new type and it shall not appear
in the type-id.
